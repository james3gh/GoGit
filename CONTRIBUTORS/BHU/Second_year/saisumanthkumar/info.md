### Ques - 1 What if you clone without fork? What problems will you face when you try to contribute in this condition?

**Ans-1** When we clone the repository without fork,the changes will be pushed to main repository but this is not possible if we dont have the access to the repo so we make a copy of the repo and push changes into it so that the owner of the repo can verify our contribution and merge it.
The main point to note here is that any changes made to the original repository will be reflected back to the forked repository. However, if you make any changes to the forked repository we will have to explicitly create a pull request to the original repository.
